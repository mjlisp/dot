Create a Dired buffer that is the union of some existing Dired buffers.
With a non-negative prefix arg, you are prompted for `ls' switches.
With a non-positive prefix arg, you are prompted for file and dir
names to add to the listing - see below.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.  Any directory names you choose this way are
included as single entries in the listing - the directory contents are
not included (these directories are not unioned).

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

From Lisp:
 DIRED-NAME is the name of the resulting Dired union buffer.

* If on a non-directory file in the top Dired directory listing, do
  nothing.

Subdirectories are listed in the same position as for `ls -lR' output.

With a prefix arg, you can edit the `ls' switches used for this
listing.  Add `R' to the switches to expand the directory tree under a
subdirectory.

Dired remembers the switches you specify with a prefix arg, so
reverting the buffer does not reset them.  However, you might
sometimes need to reset some subdirectory switches after a
`dired-undo'.  You can reset all subdirectory switches to the
default value using \\<dired-mode-map>\\[dired-reset-subdir-switches].  See Info node
`(emacs)Subdir switches' for more details.

With a prefix ARG >= 0, just find the files but do not show them.

Otherwise (no prefix ARG and nil `pop-up-frames'), the current window
is split across all marked files, as evenly as possible.  Remaining
lines go to the bottom-most window.  The number of files that can be
displayed this way is restricted by the height of the current window

Otherwise, a prefix arg behaves according to the ARG argument of
`dired-get-marked-files'.  In particular, `C-u C-u' operates on all

Mark files for which PREDICATE returns non-nil.

PREDICATE is a lisp sexp that can refer to the following symbols as
variables:

    `mode'   [string]  file permission bits, e.g. \"-rw-r--r--\"
    `nlink'  [integer] number of links to file
    `size'   [integer] file size in bytes
    `uid'    [string]  owner
    `gid'    [string]  group (If the gid is not displayed by `ls',
                       this will still be set (to the same as uid))
    `time'   [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    `name'   [string]  the name of the file
    `sym'    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
                       else \"\"
    `inode'  [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)
    `blks'   [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output
                       (ususally in blocks or, with `-k', in Kbytes)
Examples:
  Mark zero-length files: `(equal 0 size)'
  Mark files last modified on Feb 2: `(string-match \"Feb  2\" time)'
  Mark uncompiled Emacs Lisp files (`.el' file without a `.elc' file):
     First, Dired just the source files: `dired *.el'.
     Then, use \\[dired-mark-sexp] with this sexp:
          (not (file-exists-p (concat name \"c\")))

There's an ambiguity when a single integer not followed by a unit
prefix precedes the file mode: It is then parsed as inode number
and not as block size (this always works for GNU coreutils ls).

Another limitation is that the uid field is needed for the
function to work correctly.  In particular, the field is not
present for some values of `ls-lisp-emulation'.

This function operates only on the buffer content and does not
refer at all to the underlying file system.  Contrast this with
`find-dired', which might be preferable for the task at hand.
